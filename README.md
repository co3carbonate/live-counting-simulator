# Live Counting Simulator

Source code for the Live Counting Simulator Bot [/u/livecount_simulator](https://www.reddit.com/user/livecount_simulator/) by [/u/co3_carbonate](https://www.reddit.com/user/co3_carbonate/).

The bot forms partially random sentences based on the occurences and order of words in all past messages, through Markov Chains.

Made with Python. Also requires PRAW (Reddit API), and Markovify (Markov Chain library).
